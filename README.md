This is a collection of all the project done during my educational path, there are reports and for some of them, the associated MATLAB files. 

A short explanation of all the folders: 

CONTROL OF PROCESS: the project consistes of some exercises based on the assignment in the same folder, plus a report who analyses the results. 

ENERGY CONVERSION: the project is focused on the performance of a water turbine paired witha diffusor, in order to increase the efficiency.The analysis was made with ANSYS FLUENT and the data were elaborated using MATLAB. 

ENERGY MARKET: an economic investigation of a study case, in particoular of a building in which are compared the consuptions of a traditional heating system and an integrated heating system. 

INSTRUMENTATION LABORATORY: analysis of datas collected by different temperature system, whith the goal of carachetizing their performances. 

MULTIPHASE SYSTEMS: rough design of a heating system that uses heat pipes as heat exchanger. 

SMART HEATING AND COOLING SYSTEMS: investigation of a study case, in particoular of a gym in which is compared the behaviour of a traditional heating system and an integrated heating system in terms of CO2 emissions and econimc advantage.
